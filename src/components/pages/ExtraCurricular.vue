              <h2>Extra-curricular Activities</h2>

              <p>
                Extra-curricular and cultural activities are organized after lessons, such as traditional Russian matryoshka (nesting doll) painting and learning to play the balalaika, Russian folk song singing and dancing (joined classes with Russian students), watching Russian films under the supervision of the Russian Literature teacher, acting in Russian plays! You can also try your hand at pottery in specially organised classes. A personal approach is adopted in all matters, which is what has helped YRLC to establish the long record of student satisfaction of which it is proud.
              </p>

              <h4>Sporting activities (in the area)</h4>
              <ul>
                <li>A gym next door to school.</li>
                <li>A sports centre offering classes in aerobics, yoga, Zumba, pilates, etc.</li>
                <li>A sauna with a swimming pool.</li>
                <li>Jogging in a local park.</li>
              </ul>

              <p>
                Events such as activities, excursions and parties will be arranged so that YRLC students will be able to socialise with native Russian students. There will be a possibility to study and work with Russian little children, school children or adults, teaching English.
