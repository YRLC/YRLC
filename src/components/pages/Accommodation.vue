              <h2>Accomodation</h2>
              <em>
                There are many places to stay in Yaroslavl, and depending on your preference, you can stay in a hotel, an apartment, or you can live with a host family. To fully experience the Russian way of life and culture, we would recommend staying with a host. However, we do understand that may be a bit daunting for some students.

              <h3>Life with a Host</h3>
              Before coming to Russia, the idea of living with a host is quite daunting, however it is nothing to worry about! Most of the hosts in Yaroslavl have had students stay with them in the past, so they are used to having lodgers!


              If you inform the school of any requirements that you have, they will do their best to match you to a host that can accommodate them! For example if you would like to live somewhere without pets, this can be sorted out!

              The apartment you live in will have all the basic things that you need, however, don't think that it will be like a western apartment! You will be given your own bedroom, and you will have your own keys to the flat so you can come and go as you please. Your bedroom will have the basic things (bed, wardrobe, storage etc.) and will be quite comfortable.

              Your hosts will provide you with 3 meals per day. The food in Russia may not be to everyone's taste. If you let your host know the foods you prefer to eat, and are honest when you don't like something, they won't take offence if you don't eat it! If you have any dietary requirements, your host will be more than able to prepare you suitable food.


              Living with a host is an ideal way of improving your Russian, as you have more exposure to the language than you would if you were living in a hotel.


              <h3>Stay in your own Apartment</h3>
              It is possible to rent an apartment during your stay, where you would be responsible for your own food and laundry.


              <h3>Stay at a Hotel</h3>
