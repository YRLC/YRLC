                You have two choices: by road or by train. <br>
                The easiest, more convenient-especially if encumbered with baggage and probably more economical option is by road. Details of both are outlined below:

              <h3>Wish to spend several days in Moscow before travelling to Yaroslavl?</h3>

              <p>
                If for personal reasons you wish to spend several days in Moscow before travelling to Yaroslavl by train, you should bear in mind the Russian legal requirement that foreigners must register with the local authorities within 3 working days of their arrival in Russia. To prove the date of your arrival keep your ticket with you all the time! If you are not going to arrive in Yaroslavl in time to fulfil this requirement, you will need to register in Moscow or whichever town you are staying in (all the hotels have a right to register foreigners). Failure to do so is considered a serious offence, and if stopped on the street by the police for a document check and you had not registered in the required period, you could be taken to the police station for questioning and fined about 3500 roubles. If however you arrive in Yaroslavl in time to be registered with the 3 working day period, YRLC will carry out the necessary registration for you.
