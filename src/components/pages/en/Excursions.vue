              <h2>Trips and excursions</h2>
              <p>
                As Yaroslavl is conveniently situated in the very centre of Russia, it is an ideal starting point for travelling around the country. Moscow is only 3 hours and 30 minutes away by train and 1 night spent in a sleeper train will get you to Saint-Petersburg!

                YRLC provides the students with a minibus and organizes all the day trips so that they can enjoy their Russian experience fully. Details of some of these trips are shown below.

              <p>
                Students who come in winter or spring usually like to go to the outdoor skating rinks. There are several of these on the Volga and the Kotorosl rivers. There are also several places to ski - the “Dyomino” resort has a big mountain for professional skiers and the “Izgib” resort is for the more amateur skiers.

              <h3>A trip to Izgib</h3>
              <p>
                One of the most popular day trips is to “Izgib”. Everyone can find things to enjoy there. Those who can’t ski or snowboard can have fun sledging and enjoy a nice dinner in a restaurant there. Alternatively, they can bring their own meat and make shashliki on a BBQ and afterwards enjoy the peace and quiet in a little wooden hut in the forest. Here, in the forest, there is also a traditional Russian sauna, where you can experience the true Russian banya and if you're brave enough jump into the ice cold outside pool.
                In summer there are many different activities in “Izgib” such as “military camp games” with rope climbing(similar to 'going ape') and paint balling.

                There is a small horse-riding school on the edge of the city where you can ride a horse in the fields or gallop through the forest. On the opposite side there is a national park area with a pine wood and a man-made lake called Baikal because of its size. There you can have a picnic, go for walks or play outdoor games.

              <h3>A trip to the Rybinsk “Sea”</h3>
              <p>
                This is a huge man-made water reservoir, made under Stalin's orders. The building of this saw the whole town of Mologa submerged. It is now a beautiful national water reserve with thick forests around, which makes it an ideal camping, fishing and boating spot. There is also a unique fish laboratory (it used to be secret until the time of Perestroyka).They specialise in breeding rare species of fish such as sturgeon, famous for its black caviar. Ten kilos of this caviar were eaten on a floating restaurant during Millennium of Yaroslavl. It is considered as precious as diamonds.

              <h3>A trip to Kukoboi</h3>
              <p>
                Kukoboi is the name of a little village in a forest where, according to the legend, is the birthplace of the famous Russian fairytale heroine - Baba Yaga. You can still visit her there and she will welcome you with pies and shchee (traditional Russian cabbage soup) made in a Russian stove. She will also entertain you, sing songs and play games. Visiting the babushka is usually an unforgettable experience. There are even some tourists who are said to be charmed by her, so much so that they come to visit her every year.
