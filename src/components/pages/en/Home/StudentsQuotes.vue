                      During my time in Russia, I found that YRLC was by far the best choice of language school to attend. Not only did my Russian language improve dramatically, but there were a huge variety of 'typical Russianâ€™ extra-curricular activities to take part in, which enhanced the whole experience tenfold and which deepened my understanding of the Russian culture.
                      The standard of teaching was incredible and I have come away with some terrific friends and an experience that will be with me for the rest of my life.

                      Yaroslavl' as a city is, as you've probably read already several times here, averagely-sized and offers plenty to see and do. However if, like me, you're wanting to see a wider variety of places in Russia, Yaroslavl' is a perfect springboard for visiting virtually anywhere in the country while still offering the genuine Russian experience not so easily found in Moscow or St Petersburg. All the other positive points about the town - such as the more thorough immersion into the language, the local atmosphere being less effected by western influence than the capital, and its comfortable balance between large town and small city were only as important to me as its location and travel opportunities.

                      My Yaroslavl experience was fantastic and something totally new to me. Having never visited Russia before, Yaroslavl was billed as the 'Real Russia', and that's something that's very obvious. Yaroslavl isn't Moscow or St. Petersburg, but in many ways that's a good thing. On a practical level, the size of the town means that it's easy to get around, and it's certainly cheaper than the bigger cities. The sheer quantity of random events going on here means that there's always something interesting going on. During my stay, I managed to go to a Tatar-style shashlyk BBQ, go to the Miss Yaroslavl pageant, take up the balalaika and end up making friends with local people through the local communication medium, vodka.

                      The teaching at the YRLC has been some of the best I have received in my six years of studying Russian.  Lessons are thorough and well organised, however it is the teacher's willingness to go the extra mile and ability to explain complex ideas in simple, understandable ways that really stands out.

                      The landladies organised through the school are lovely and will keep you very well fed!  I've really enjoyed my time here and highly recommend the opportunity to all prospective students.
                      Thanks again for your help today with the essay planning, I really appreciate it!
