              <h3>Individual courses</h3>
              <p>
                We organize individual courses for masters students, professionals such as interpreters, businessmen, engineers, cooks, pharmacists and now even aircraft engineers. They can be of any required length and intensity.
              </p>
              <p>
                And fun courses for school children during the holidays when we combine classes with entertainment such as skiing, snowboarding, skating in winter and hiking, paintball, boating, horse riding in summer.

                The day of arrival of every course is Saturday, Sunday is a Day with a Family (to explore things around) and Monday is the beginning of the course.

              <p>
                Students must buy their own travel tickets for the appropriate date, shown on the website, and inform YRLC about their travel arrangements so that any transfers from Moscow airport to Yaroslavl can be arranged.
