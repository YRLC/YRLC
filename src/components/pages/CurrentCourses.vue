              <p>All the students are offered to obtain Multi-Entry Visas while they study at YRLC.</p>

                This gives them an opportunity to travel around Russia or go home or on holiday during their breaks.

              <p>
                The day of arrival of every course is Saturday, Sunday is a Day with a Family (to explore things around) and Monday is the beginning of the course.
              </p>
              <p>
                Students must buy their own travel tickets for the appropriate date, shown on the website, and inform YRLC about their travel arrangements so that any transfers from Moscow airport to Yaroslavl can be arranged.
              </p>

              <p>NOTE: Students from the same Universities are asked to organise their groups and fly all together.</p>
